Article: [You Will Never Succeed If You Keep Applying for Jobs Online](https://pub.towardsai.net/you-will-never-succeed-if-you-keep-applying-for-jobs-online-1107ccbc9ac9)

- Stop bulk applying online for jobs you’ve found on some websites. It’s not a numbers game.
- Use the saved time in networking. The best place online I can think of to do that is LinkedIn. You can attend offline meetups/conferences too based on your preferences. Targeting the right people would be key here.
- Add value to your network. Actively engage with them while showcasing your skills. It’s the best way to let your network see your potential.
- Reach out and let your connection know if you’re on the lookout for jobs. If they can’t help you at the moment, don’t be pushy, the referral will eventually come.
- Once you have the referral, tailor your CV and cover letter for the role you’re interviewing for.
- Acquire relevant skills. Start with this right now. If you’re not a good fit, the above strategies are of no use.
